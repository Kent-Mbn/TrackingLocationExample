This is a example, I attached files of library to project.
If you want to add your project. You copy directory of library to your project. In Appdelegate.m you only code some lines, follow in example project.

When you code 'START', the system tracking will begin. It will throw notification which contains new location. And...use it!

This library run well on ios 7 and 8 or more...
Tracking when app is background mode, active mode and app is killed.
It is written by Objective-C

Base on code from: http://mobileoop.com/background-location-update-programming-for-ios-7

Please give me any feedback from you!
Thank you!
